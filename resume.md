## Summary
I am extensively trained in molecular and cell biology techniques with over nine years of experience in research laboratories. I have served roles such as senior level research associate, technician, and lab manager and I have worked in both in academic and start-up biotechnology lab environments.  I have a drive to accomplish high quality research and have never shied from complicated techniques.

 ## Research Skills
* Immunoblotting  (SDS-PAGE and Western blotting)
* _in vitro_ protein translation and assays                          
* _in vivo_ recombinant protein generation, purification, and analysis
* Tissue/Cell culture and sterile technique
* Protein design
* Immunostaining of fixed tissues and cells
* Microinjection
* Confocal microscopy of live and fixed tissues and cells
* mRNA and RNA prep
* Site-directed mutagenesis
* qPCR, RT-PCR, and RACE-PCR
* Molecular DNA cloning (restriction enzyme digests, DNA ligations, and construct generation)
* DNA and RNA purifications from cells, tissues, and bacteria
* DNA and protein sequence analysis  
* Animal colony management
* Oligo and protein conjugation techniques
* High-Throughput Screening (ex. 98-well screens)

## Work Experience

### Stratos Genomics, Seattle WA   
#### Senior Research Associate
_June 2016-Present_
#### Research Associate
_January 2015-June 2016_

Part of the Protein Engineering Team where we utilize a variety of techniques to develop polymerases that push the boundaries of nucleotide extension.  

##### Experience
* Expressing and purifying fusion proteins using _E.coli_ and affinity purification.
* Developing novel mRNA/DNA Display protocols involving IVTT and protein fusion
capture on bead.
* Designing and executing polymerase extension assays using novel nucleotide substrates.
* Screening polymerase function in 98-well screens.
* Designing proteins using computational tools.

### Fred Hutchison Cancer Research Center, Seattle WA
#### Research Technician II
_July 2014-December 2014_

Member of the Priess lab where I investigated molecular and cellular events that occurred during apoptosis in _C. elegans_- specifically the role of mitochondria and microtubules during cell death.

#### Experience
* Routinely optimized and performed antibody immunostaining and live imaging of _C. elegans_ gonads.           
* Maintained an extensive stock of _C. elegans_ strains and set-up new strain crosses as needed.

### University of Michigan, Ann Arbor MI
#### Lab Technician Senior and Lab Manager
_July 2011- June 2014_

 Member of the Miller lab where I investigated Rho-GTPase regulation of cell division using _Xenopus laevis_. I utilized live and fixed cell imaging, protein interaction assays, and microtubule manipulations to study Centralspindlin localization at the equatorial cell cortex.

 #### Experience   
* Pioneered various unpublished techniques including monopolar spindle generation in an intact cell epithelium and GST pulldowns with _X. laevis_ embryos.
* Maintained lab inventories and responsible for lab ordering and supply tracking.
